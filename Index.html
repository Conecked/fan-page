<h2>Bio...</h2>

    <p>
        Living Legends originally grew out of Mystik Journeymen, which consisted of BFAP (now known as Sunspot Jonz) and PSC (now known as Luckyiam). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beginning in 1994, the Mystik Journeymen began cultivating a fan base by selling their own tapes on the streets and hosting "Underground Survivors" shows in East Oakland. 
        In 1995, the duo met The Grouch. In 1996, Mystik Journeymen and The Grouch joined with the trio known as 3 Melancholy Gypsys (Eligh, Scarub, and Murs) of Los Angeles.
        They soon embarked on the first of several of self-funded tours throughout Europe.  
    </p>
    <p>
        They formed the Living Legends Crew in the late 1990s. The crew has since grown to include Bicasso, Aesop and Arata. With the crew mentality, many have embarked on solo projects as well as group albums. 
        Grouch and Eligh have formed G&E; Grouch and Luckyiam are CMA (Calfornia Music Authority); while also being featured and featuring many emcees from the underground community.
